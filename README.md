# MachineLearning

### Timelines of Machine Learning 
    Electronic Brain, Perceptron, Adaline, XOR, MultiLayered Perceptron, SVM, Deep neural networks

### Supervised Learning
    Branch of ML which works with labeled data
    Goal is to predict the labels for the new data
    Common models used were regression (Numerical Data) and classification (Categorical Data)
    Example Model is to predict the price of an house 

    Commonly used algorithms based on the data
    1. Regression
    2. Classifier
        * Naive Bayes Algorithms (Gauss, Mulitnomial, Bernoulli)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3dZ6ZNFjo0
    
### UnSupervised Learning
    Branch of ML which works with unlabeled data
    Goal is to predict the state 
    Clustering , Dimensionality reduction
    Example Model is to classify whether incoming email is spam or not
    Stock Market predicting the price of the market based on some conditions & signals, 
    Sales predicting how much user will spend, Medicine predicting the life span of it , Video Recommendation to predict amount of time user spends on a video
    classification models predict a state
    Sometimes unsupervised learning used as preprocess step
